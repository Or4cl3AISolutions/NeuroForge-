# NeuroForge: Conceptual Design for Cognitive Profiling

This document outlines the conceptual design for NeuroForge's cognitive profiling capabilities. It details the data sources, the role of PyTorch in generating behavioral heatmaps and predictive learning trajectories, and the overall data flow. This system aims to create a dynamic understanding of each user's learning patterns, strengths, weaknesses, and optimal paths.

## 1. Data Sources for Cognitive Profiling

A rich and diverse set of data points will be collected to build comprehensive cognitive profiles. These data points are primarily captured through the `/profiling/interactions` endpoint of the Cognitive Profiling Service, as well as potentially through direct data feeds from other services.

*   **Interaction Patterns:**
    *   **Navigation Paths:** Sequence of `ContentModules`, `Concepts`, and `Skills` visited by the user. This shows their exploration strategy and areas of interest or confusion.
    *   **Time Spent:** Duration of engagement with `ContentModules`, specific pages, videos, or interactive elements within them. Normalized time can indicate interest, difficulty, or thoroughness.
    *   **Feature Usage:** Frequency and context of using platform features like AI mentor queries, glossary lookups, forum participation (if available), bookmarking, note-taking.
    *   **Content Consumption Speed:** Video playback speed settings, scrolling speed on articles (if measurable), indicating preferred pace or engagement level.
    *   **Repetition & Review:** How often users revisit `ContentModules` or `Concepts`, signaling areas they find difficult or important to reinforce.
    *   **Interactive Element Engagement:** Data from simulations, coding exercises (e.g., code submissions, execution results, errors), interactive quizzes within modules. This includes specific interactions, not just final scores.
    *   **Search Queries:** Internal search terms used by the learner, indicating immediate information needs or knowledge gaps.

*   **Assessment Data:** (Relating to `Assessment` nodes from `neuroforge_neo4j_datamodel.md`)
    *   **Scores & Grades:** Performance on quizzes, tests, projects, and other formal assessments.
    *   **Specific Answers:** Capturing the actual answers given (correct/incorrect, and the specific incorrect choice if multiple-choice) to identify patterns in misunderstandings.
    *   **Time to Complete:** Duration taken for assessments, which can correlate with fluency or difficulty.
    *   **Number of Attempts:** How many times an assessment was attempted before passing or achieving a certain score.
    *   **Error Categorization:** If possible, classify types of errors made (e.g., conceptual misunderstanding, calculation error, syntax error in code).

*   **AI Mentor Interactions:** (Data from AI Mentor Service)
    *   **Topics of Discussion:** Concepts, skills, or problems users discuss with the AI Mentor.
    *   **Questions Asked:** The nature and complexity of questions posed, including requests for clarification or deeper explanations.
    *   **Expressed Confidence/Confusion:** Sentiment analysis or explicit statements of confidence/confusion within mentor dialogues (e.g., "I'm not sure I get X," or "That makes sense now!").
    *   **Feedback on AI Responses:** User ratings or comments on the helpfulness of mentor explanations.

*   **User Feedback (Explicit):**
    *   **Content Ratings:** User ratings on `ContentModules` for difficulty, clarity, relevance.
    *   **Self-Reported Understanding:** Surveys or prompts where users can indicate their perceived understanding of a topic or confidence in a skill.
    *   **Goal Setting:** User-defined learning goals and priorities.

*   **Learning Path Progress:** (Data from Learning Pathway Service)
    *   **Progression Pace:** Speed of completing modules and stages within predefined or dynamic `LearningPaths`.
    *   **Path Choices:** Decisions made at forks or optional sections in `LearningPaths`.
    *   **Stagnation/Drop-off Points:** Identifying where users slow down significantly or abandon a learning path.
    *   **Sequence Adherence:** Whether users follow recommended sequences or jump between modules.

*   **Social Learning Data (Future Scope):**
    *   **Collaboration Patterns:** Interactions in group projects or study groups.
    *   **Peer Review Feedback:** Quality and nature of feedback given and received.
    *   **Forum Activity:** Questions asked, answers provided, discussions engaged in.

## 2. Behavioral Heatmapping with PyTorch

Behavioral heatmaps will provide visual representations of a user's cognitive state across various dimensions of the learning landscape.

**Concept:**
In this context, a behavioral heatmap is a data visualization technique where values representing different aspects of user behavior or inferred states (e.g., engagement, mastery, difficulty) are mapped to a matrix or graph structure (e.g., concepts within a domain, skills in a curriculum). Colors or intensity typically represent the magnitude of the value, allowing for quick identification of patterns, strengths, and weaknesses.

**PyTorch Role:**
PyTorch models will be employed to process the diverse collected data and transform it into meaningful values for generating heatmaps.

*   **Model Architectures:**
    *   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs/LSTMs/GRUs):** Suitable for processing sequential data like navigation paths, sequences of module interactions, or time-series of performance on assessments. They can learn patterns over time.
    *   **Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs):** Can be used for processing aggregated features or simpler, non-sequential data (e.g., average time spent, overall scores) to predict a specific heatmap value for a concept/skill.
    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** If we want the heatmap to inherently understand the relationships between concepts/skills (from the Knowledge Graph), GNNs could learn representations for each concept/skill node by aggregating information from its neighbors and user interactions related to it. This is a more advanced approach.
    *   **Attention Mechanisms:** Can be combined with RNNs or other architectures to help the model focus on the most relevant interaction events when generating a profile component.

*   **Input Features (Examples):**
    *   **For each Concept/Skill:**
        *   Normalized time spent on related `ContentModules`.
        *   Frequency of interaction with related modules/resources.
        *   Correctness rate in related `Assessments`.
        *   Number of AI Mentor queries related to it.
        *   Recency of interaction.
        *   Self-reported confidence/understanding.
        *   Number of repetitions/reviews.
    *   Features would be engineered (e.g., aggregated, normalized, encoded) from the raw data sources listed in Section 1.

*   **Potential Outputs (Heatmap Values per Concept/Skill):**
    *   **Engagement Score:** A value (e.g., 0-1) indicating the level of active interaction with a concept/skill.
    *   **Mastery Score:** An estimated level of proficiency or understanding (e.g., "Novice", "Intermediate", "Expert" mapped to numerical values).
    *   **Struggle Score:** A value indicating the likelihood that the user is finding a concept/skill challenging (e.g., based on high time spent with low assessment scores, repeated views, frequent AI mentor help).
    *   **Interest Score:** Inferred interest based on voluntary interactions, positive feedback, or deep engagement.

**Example Heatmap Applications:**

*   **"Concept Engagement Heatmap":**
    *   Visualizes which concepts (perhaps within a specific domain) a user interacts with most frequently or spends the most time on. Helps identify areas of high interest or potential areas where they are "stuck."
*   **"Skill Mastery Heatmap":**
    *   Displays the user's estimated proficiency levels across a predefined set of skills. Useful for users to see their strengths and for the system to recommend areas for improvement.
*   **"Content Perceived Difficulty Heatmap":**
    *   Aggregated across users, this could show which `ContentModules` or `Concepts` generally pose the most challenge (e.g., high average time spent, high failure rates on related assessments). For individual users, it shows their personal "difficulty landscape."
*   **"Learning Velocity Heatmap":**
    *   Shows the rate of progress or mastery gain for different concepts/skills over time.

## 3. Predictive Learning Trajectories with PyTorch

Predictive learning trajectories involve using AI to forecast a user's future learning path, potential successes or difficulties, and optimal next steps.

**Concept:**
These are AI-driven predictions about a user's learning journey. Instead of just reflecting current or past states (like heatmaps), trajectories look forward. They can help in personalizing learning paths dynamically, offering timely interventions, and managing user motivation.

**PyTorch Role:**
PyTorch models, particularly sequence models, are well-suited for predicting these trajectories.

*   **Model Architectures:**
    *   **LSTMs/GRUs/Transformers:** These models can learn from sequences of user interactions, module completions, assessment results, and changes in heatmap values over time. They can capture temporal dependencies and project them into the future.
    *   **Survival Models / Hazard Models (adapted for ML):** Could be used to predict time-to-completion for modules/paths or likelihood of dropping off.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL - advanced):** An RL agent could learn a policy to recommend next steps that maximize long-term learning gain or engagement, effectively shaping the trajectory.

*   **Input Features:**
    *   Historical sequences of:
        *   `ContentModules` completed/attempted.
        *   `Assessments` taken and their scores.
        *   Interaction events (types and frequencies).
        *   Changes in behavioral heatmap values over time.
    *   Current cognitive profile (latest heatmap values).
    *   User's stated goals (from `User` node or Learning Pathway Service).
    *   Properties of upcoming `ContentModules` or `Concepts` in a potential path (e.g., difficulty, modality).

*   **Potential Predictions:**
    *   **Path Completion Likelihood:** Probability of a user successfully completing their current `LearningPath` or a specific future path.
    *   **Skill/Concept Mastery Probability:** Likelihood of achieving a target proficiency level in a `Skill` or `Concept` within a certain timeframe or number of interactions.
    *   **Optimal Next Content/Concept:** Recommending the next `ContentModule`, `Concept`, or `Assessment` that is predicted to be most beneficial for learning, engagement, or reaching a goal.
    *   **At-Risk Identification:** Early detection of users who are likely to become disengaged, fall behind, or fail to meet their objectives.
    *   **Time to Completion Estimation:** Predicting how long a user might take to complete a module or learning path.

**Example Predictive Applications:**

*   **"Adaptive Learning Path Adjustment":**
    *   If a user is predicted to struggle with an upcoming advanced module, the system might proactively suggest a prerequisite refresher or an alternative, easier module.
*   **"Personalized Pacing Guide":**
    *   Estimate optimal time allocations for upcoming modules based on the user's learning speed trajectory.
*   **"Early Intervention Alerts":**
    *   Flag users whose trajectory indicates a high risk of disengagement, allowing educators or the AI Mentor to offer support.
*   **"Goal Achievement Forecast":**
    *   Provide users with an estimate of when they might achieve their learning goals based on their current trajectory, potentially boosting motivation.

## 4. Data Flow and Processing Outline

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   User interactions across the platform (UI, Content Service, AI Mentor, etc.) generate event data.
    *   This data is sent to the **Cognitive Profiling Service**, primarily via its `/profiling/interactions` API endpoint (as defined in `neuroforge_api_design.md`).
    *   Other services (e.g., Learning Pathway Service for enrollment/completion events) might also push relevant data directly or via a message queue.

2.  **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Raw Data Storage:** Incoming interaction data is initially stored (e.g., in a NoSQL DB like MongoDB or a data lake for raw events).
    *   **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing noise, standardizing formats.
    *   **Transformation:** Converting raw data into usable features. Examples:
        *   Aggregating time spent per module/concept.
        *   Calculating success rates for assessments.
        *   Encoding categorical data (e.g., module types, interaction types).
        *   Normalizing numerical features.
        *   Generating embeddings for textual data (e.g., AI mentor queries).
    *   **Sequence Generation:** For trajectory models, user interactions are ordered chronologically to form sequences.

3.  **PyTorch Model Processing:**
    *   Scheduled batch jobs or event-triggered processes feed the engineered features into the relevant PyTorch models (for heatmaps and/or predictive trajectories).
    *   Models are trained (initially) and then used for inference. Training would involve historical data and appropriate labels (e.g., actual mastery achieved, observed engagement patterns).

4.  **Output Storage & Access:**
    *   **Heatmap Values & Profile Summaries:** The outputs from the PyTorch models (scores, classifications, predictions) forming the cognitive profile are stored.
        *   A summary or key components of the profile (e.g., dominant learning styles, key strengths/weaknesses from heatmaps) can be stored in the `User` node's `cognitiveProfile` JSON blob in Neo4j for quick access by services like the AI Mentor.
        *   More detailed heatmap data or historical profiles might reside in a dedicated analytics database (e.g., PostgreSQL, a time-series DB) linked to the `userId`.
    *   **Predictive Trajectories:** Predictions (e.g., next recommended module, risk score) can be stored similarly or consumed directly by relevant services.

5.  **Making Profiles Available:**
    *   Other services (AI Mentor, Learning Pathway Service, UI Service) can access cognitive profile information:
        *   Via dedicated API endpoints on the Cognitive Profiling Service (e.g., `GET /profiling/users/{userId}/summary`, `GET /profiling/users/{userId}/heatmap`, and new endpoints for predictive outputs like `GET /profiling/users/{userId}/trajectory/next-module`).
        *   The AI Mentor can use this data to tailor explanations and suggestions.
        *   The Learning Pathway Service can use it to dynamically adjust path recommendations.
        *   The UI can use it to display progress and insights to the user.
