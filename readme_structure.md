    *   LLMs: OpenAI GPT series / Google Gemini / Llama 3 / Mistral
    *   Frameworks: LangChain / LlamaIndex
*   **Cognitive Profiling:** PyTorch
*   **Knowledge Graph Database:** Neo4j

*   **Blockchain:** Polygon (PoS) for credentials (ERC-721/ERC-1155 NFTs)
*   **Messaging/Queues:** RabbitMQ / Apache Kafka
*   **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes (K8s)
*   *(Summarized from `neuroforge_architecture.md`)*

## Data Management

*   **Knowledge Graph (Neo4j):**
    *   Role: Central repository for semantic mapping of `Concepts`, `Skills`, `ContentModules`, `LearningObjectives`, and their interrelationships.
    *   Enables: Advanced content discovery, prerequisite understanding, personalized path generation.
    *   Reference: See [NeuroForge Neo4j Data Model](./neuroforge_neo4j_datamodel.md) for details.
*   **Cognitive Profiling Data:**
    *   Collection: User interaction data (navigation, time spent, assessment results, AI mentor queries) is collected via the Cognitive Profiling Service.
    *   Usage: This data feeds into PyTorch models to generate behavioral heatmaps and predictive learning trajectories, personalizing the learning experience.
    *   Reference: See [NeuroForge Cognitive Profiling Design](./neuroforge_cognitive_profiling_design.md).

## AI Components

*   **AI Mentor:**
    *   Role: Provides personalized guidance, answers questions, explains concepts, and suggests resources.
    *   LLM Integration: Leverages state-of-the-art LLMs.
    *   Memory: Utilizes short-term (session) and long-term (vector database) memory for context-aware interactions.
    *   Customization: Features customizable personas, verbosity, and interaction styles.
    *   KG Integration: Queries the Knowledge Graph for factual grounding and relevant content suggestions.
    *   Reference: See [NeuroForge AI Mentor Scaffolding](./neuroforge_ai_mentor_scaffolding.md).
*   **Cognitive Profiling (PyTorch-driven):**
    *   Behavioral Heatmapping: Generates insights into user engagement, mastery, and areas of difficulty across different concepts and skills.
    *   Predictive Learning Trajectories: Forecasts user progress, potential challenges, and optimal next learning steps.
    *   Reference: See [NeuroForge Cognitive Profiling Design](./neuroforge_cognitive_profiling_design.md).

## Blockchain Credentialing Overview

*   **Approach:** Issues verifiable micro-credentials and diplomas as NFTs on a public blockchain.
*   **Platform:** Polygon (PoS) for its scalability, low cost, and EVM compatibility.
*   **Standards:**
    *   NFTs: ERC-721 for unique credential representation.
    *   Metadata: Stored on IPFS, linked via `tokenURI`, following ERC-721 metadata schema and compatible with Open Badges.
    *   Optional: Integration with W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs).
*   **Benefits:** User ownership, global verifiability, enhanced credential security and portability.
*   **Reference:** See [NeuroForge Blockchain Credentialing Design](./neuroforge_blockchain_credentialing_design.md).

## Security and Privacy Highlights

*   **Commitment:** NeuroForge is committed to robust data security and user privacy.
*   **Key Measures:**
    *   Data Encryption: In transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256 for databases, storage).
    *   Access Controls: Strong authentication (MFA, OAuth 2.0), authorization (RBAC, PoLP).
    *   Network Security: VPCs, firewalls, IDS/IPS.
    *   Application Security: Secure coding (OWASP), audits, WAF.
*   **Compliance Considerations:** Strategies for GDPR and FERPA compliance (data subject rights, consent, protection of education records).
*   **Ethical AI:** Proactive monitoring and mitigation strategies for potential biases in AI components.
*   **Reference:** See [NeuroForge Security and Privacy Framework](./neuroforge_security_privacy_framework.md).

## Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Summary

*   **Title:** NeuroForge AI-Powered Concept Explanation and Content Recommendation PoC.
*   **Goal:** Validate the core interaction loop between a simplified UI, AI Mentor (with external LLM), and Knowledge Graph (with minimal data) for providing explanations and content suggestions.
*   **Key Components in PoC:** Simplified UI, AI Mentor Service, Knowledge Graph Service (Neo4j), mocked User, Content Delivery, and Cognitive Profiling services.
*   **Scenario Highlight:** User asks about a concept; AI Mentor fetches data from KG, uses it to prompt an LLM for an explanation, and then suggests related content modules from the KG.
*   **Reference:** See [NeuroForge PoC Definition](./neuroforge_poc_definition.md).
