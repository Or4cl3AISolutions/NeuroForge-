# NeuroForge: Security and Privacy Framework

This document outlines the conceptual security and privacy framework for NeuroForge. It addresses core security measures, compliance with regulations like GDPR and FERPA, and strategies for ethical bias monitoring in AI components. This framework aims to protect sensitive user data and ensure responsible AI practices.

## 1. Core Security Measures

A multi-layered security approach will be implemented to protect NeuroForge's systems and user data.

### 1.1 Data Encryption

*   **In Transit:**
    *   All API communications, both internal (service-to-service) and external (client-to-API Gateway), will be encrypted using **TLS 1.2 or higher (SSL)**.
    *   Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers will be used to ensure browsers only connect over HTTPS.
*   **At Rest:**
    *   **Databases:**
        *   **PostgreSQL:** Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) will be enabled where available, or at-rest encryption features provided by the cloud provider (e.g., AWS RDS encryption, Azure SQL Database TDE) will be utilized.
        *   **MongoDB:** Encrypted storage engine will be used, or filesystem-level encryption will be applied to the underlying storage volumes.
        *   **Neo4j:** Filesystem-level encryption for data at rest. Cloud provider encryption for managed Neo4j instances.
        *   **Vector Databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate):** These managed services typically offer built-in encryption at rest. For self-hosted solutions like FAISS with pgvector, the underlying PostgreSQL encryption applies.
    *   **Object Storage (for content modules, backups):** Server-Side Encryption (SSE) will be enabled using strong algorithms (e.g., AES-256) on cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
    *   **Backups:** All database and file storage backups will be encrypted.
    *   **Key Management:**
        *   A dedicated Key Management Service (KMS) (e.g., **AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault**) will be used for managing encryption keys.
        *   Keys will be rotated regularly according to best practices.
        *   Access to key management systems will be strictly controlled.

### 1.2 Access Control

*   **Authentication:**
    *   The **User Service** will implement robust authentication mechanisms, preferably **OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC)** for user authentication against the API Gateway.
    *   Password policies will enforce complexity and regular rotation. Passwords will be stored hashed using strong algorithms (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt).
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Options for MFA (e.g., TOTP apps, SMS, security keys) will be provided for all users, and potentially mandated for administrative roles.
*   **Authorization:**
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
        *   Users will be assigned roles (e.g., "learner", "educator", "admin", "content_manager", "support_agent").
        *   Each role will have specific permissions defining what actions they can perform and what data they can access within each service.
        *   Permissions will be granular and enforced at the API level within each microservice.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):**
        *   Service-to-service communication will use dedicated service accounts or tokens with the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
        *   Users will only have access to the data and functionalities explicitly required for their role.

### 1.3 Network Security

*   **Network Isolation:**
    *   Backend services will be deployed within **Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)** or equivalent isolated networks (e.g., Azure Virtual Networks).
    *   Subnets will be used to further segregate services based on sensitivity and function (e.g., database subnet, application subnet).
    *   Strict firewall rules (network security groups, NACLs) will control inbound and outbound traffic between subnets and to/from the internet. Only necessary ports and protocols will be allowed.
*   **API Gateway:** The API Gateway will serve as the single, controlled entry point for all external traffic to backend services.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
    *   IDS/IPS solutions will be deployed to monitor network traffic for malicious activity and policy violations, providing alerts and potentially blocking threats.
*   **DDoS Mitigation:** Utilize cloud provider services or dedicated DDoS mitigation solutions to protect against Distributed Denial of Service attacks.

### 1.4 Application Security

*   **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   Development teams will be trained on secure coding practices, following guidelines such as the **OWASP Top 10**.
    *   Code reviews will include security checks.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Independent third-party security audits and penetration tests will be conducted regularly (e.g., annually or after major changes).
*   **Dependency Scanning:**
    *   Automated tools will scan application dependencies (libraries, frameworks) for known vulnerabilities (e.g., Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check).
*   **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**
    *   All user inputs will be validated on both client-side (for usability) and server-side (for security) to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
    *   Output encoding will be applied when rendering user-supplied data to prevent XSS.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF will be deployed in front of the API Gateway to protect against common web exploits.
*   **Secrets Management:** Sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and certificates will be stored securely using services like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secret managers (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).

### 1.5 Incident Response Plan

A documented incident response plan will be in place, outlining procedures for handling security incidents. Key elements include:

1.  **Preparation:** Defining roles and responsibilities, training, establishing communication channels, and ensuring necessary tools are available.
2.  **Identification:** Processes for detecting and reporting security incidents (e.g., monitoring alerts, user reports).
3.  **Containment:** Steps to limit the scope and impact of an incident (e.g., isolating affected systems, blocking malicious IPs).
4.  **Eradication:** Removing the root cause of the incident (e.g., patching vulnerabilities, removing malware).
5.  **Recovery:** Safely restoring affected systems and data, and validating their integrity.
6.  **Lessons Learned:** Post-incident analysis to identify improvements in security measures and the response plan itself.

## 2. GDPR/FERPA Compliance Strategy

NeuroForge is committed to complying with relevant data protection regulations.

### 2.1 GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

*   **Lawful Basis for Processing:** Identify and document the lawful basis for each data processing activity (e.g., consent, contract, legitimate interest).
*   **Data Minimization:** Only personal data necessary for specific, declared purposes will be collected and processed.
*   **Consent Management:**
    *   Clear, granular, and unambiguous consent will be obtained from users for processing their personal data where consent is the lawful basis (e.g., for specific AI features, non-essential cookies).
    *   Users will be able to easily withdraw consent at any time. Records of consent will be maintained.
*   **Data Subject Rights:** NeuroForge will implement processes to support:
    *   **Right to Access:** Users can request a copy of their personal data held by NeuroForge.
    *   **Right to Rectification:** Users can request correction of inaccurate personal data.
    *   **Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten'):** Users can request deletion of their personal data under certain conditions.
    *   **Right to Data Portability:** Users can request their data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format to transmit to another controller.
    *   **Right to Restrict Processing & Right to Object:** Users can request restriction or object to certain processing activities.
*   **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs):** DPIAs will be conducted for high-risk processing activities, especially for new AI features involving extensive profiling or automated decision-making.
*   **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs):** DPAs will be in place with all third-party vendors (sub-processors) that process personal data on behalf of NeuroForge.
*   **Appointment of DPO (Data Protection Officer):** A DPO will be appointed if NeuroForge's processing activities meet the criteria requiring one (based on scale, nature of data, etc.). Otherwise, a dedicated privacy lead will be assigned.
*   **Breach Notification:** In case of a personal data breach, NeuroForge will notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours (if required) and affected data subjects without undue delay if the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms.
*   **Records of Processing Activities (RoPA):** Maintain internal records of all data processing activities.
*   **Privacy by Design and by Default:** Privacy considerations will be integrated into the design and development of all new systems and features.

### 2.2 FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)

Applicable if NeuroForge directly partners with or provides services to US educational institutions subject to FERPA.

*   **Protection of Student Education Records:**
    *   **Definition:** "Education records" will be clearly defined within the NeuroForge context. This includes learning progress, assessment data, cognitive profiles, AI mentor interactions, and any other data directly related to a student's educational journey on the platform that is maintained by or on behalf of an educational institution.
    *   **Data Security:** All core security measures (encryption, access control) apply to protect these records.
*   **Consent for Disclosure:**
    *   Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from student education records will not be disclosed to third parties without prior written consent from the parent or eligible student (student aged 18 or older), except under specific FERPA-permitted exceptions (e.g., school officials with legitimate educational interest, for financial aid, state/local authorities under specific conditions).
    *   NeuroForge will act as a "school official" with "legitimate educational interests" when providing services to an institution, as defined in agreements with the institution.
*   **Access by Parents/Eligible Students:** Parents or eligible students will have the right to inspect and review the student's education records maintained by NeuroForge on behalf of the institution. Mechanisms will be provided (likely through the partner institution) to facilitate such requests.
*   **Directory Information:**
    *   NeuroForge will work with partner institutions to understand their directory information policies.
    *   If NeuroForge handles directory information (e.g., student name, participation in officially recognized activities), it will comply with the institution's policy regarding what is designated as directory information and the institution's process for allowing parents/eligible students to opt-out of its disclosure.
*   **Data De-identification:** When using education records for research or product improvement, data will be de-identified according to FERPA standards to protect student privacy.

### 2.3 On-Device Anonymized Processing (Conceptual)

To further enhance privacy, NeuroForge will explore possibilities for on-device processing for certain sensitive computations or data preprocessing, especially for cognitive profiling.

*   **Concept:** Instead of sending all raw interaction data to the server, some initial processing or feature extraction could occur on the user's client device (browser or mobile app).
*   **Example:**
    *   Basic interaction counts (e.g., clicks, time on page segments) could be aggregated locally before being sent as summarized, less granular data.
    *   For AI-driven text analysis (e.g., sentiment in drafted notes for the AI mentor), if feasible with lightweight models, some initial feature extraction could happen on-device.
*   **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Data could be partially anonymized or pseudonymized on the device before transmission, reducing the direct identifiability of raw behavioral streams.
*   **Challenges:** This is technically complex, requires capable client devices, increases client-side resource usage, and needs careful design to ensure the processed data is still useful for the intended profiling. The feasibility will be evaluated for specific use cases.

## 3. Ethical Bias Monitoring in AI Components

Ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in AI components (AI Mentor, Cognitive Profiling) is a key ethical commitment.

*   **Key Areas:**
    *   **AI Mentor:** Bias in language, tone, explanations, or suggestions for learning paths/resources.
    *   **Cognitive Profiling:** Bias in how user behavior is interpreted, leading to inaccurate profiles or unfair predictive learning trajectories (e.g., consistently underestimating capabilities of certain groups).

*   **Types of Bias to Monitor:**
    *   **Data Bias:** Biases stemming from the data used to train AI models (e.g., demographic underrepresentation, societal stereotypes reflected in text data).
    *   **Algorithmic Bias:** Bias introduced by the model architecture, optimization function, or feature selection process.
    *   **Interaction/Presentation Bias:** How the AI Mentor interacts with different users or how cognitive profile insights are presented, potentially reinforcing stereotypes or creating self-fulfilling prophecies.
    *   **Measurement Bias:** How user performance or behavior is measured, potentially disadvantaging certain groups.
    *   **Evaluation Bias:** Biases in how AI models are benchmarked and evaluated for fairness.

*   **Monitoring Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Audits of Training Data:** Analyze datasets used for training PyTorch models (for cognitive profiling) and potentially for fine-tuning LLMs (for AI Mentor) to identify and mitigate demographic imbalances or stereotype propagation.
    *   **Fairness Metrics:**
        *   Define and track relevant fairness metrics for AI model predictions (e.g., in predictive learning trajectories from the Cognitive Profiling Service, or in content recommendation scores from the AI Mentor).
        *   Examples: Demographic Parity (equal positive prediction rates across groups), Equalized Odds (equal true positive and false positive rates), Predictive Equality (equal precision).
        *   These require careful consideration of how user groups are defined (e.g., based on self-declared demographic data if ethically collected with consent, or via proxy variables if direct data is unavailable/undesirable).
    *   **User Feedback Mechanisms:** Provide clear channels for users to report perceived bias in AI interactions, content recommendations, or their cognitive profile insights. This feedback will be reviewed by a dedicated team.
    *   **A/B Testing & Counterfactual Analysis:**
        *   Test AI responses and recommendations with controlled variations in simulated user profiles or inputs to detect systematically different or unfair outcomes for different groups.
        *   Analyze if similar user behaviors lead to different cognitive profile interpretations based on group affiliation.
    *   **Explainability Techniques (XAI):**
        *   Employ techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to understand which input features most influence the outputs of PyTorch models in the Cognitive Profiling Service. This can help uncover hidden biases or reliance on inappropriate proxies.
        *   For the AI Mentor (LLMs), analyze attention weights or use prompt engineering techniques to understand how context influences responses.
    *   **Bias Detection Tools:** Explore and utilize available tools designed to detect bias in machine learning models and datasets.
    *   **Human Review Panels:** Establish diverse human review panels to periodically assess AI Mentor interactions and cognitive profile outputs for subtle biases or fairness concerns.

*   **Mitigation Strategies (High-Level):**
    *   **Data Pre-processing:** Techniques like re-sampling, re-weighting, or data augmentation to create more balanced training datasets.
    *   **In-processing (Bias-Aware Model Training):** Modifying learning algorithms to incorporate fairness constraints during model training.
    *   **Post-processing:** Adjusting model outputs or decision thresholds to achieve fairer outcomes across groups.
    *   **Algorithm Selection:** Choosing model architectures that are inherently less prone to certain types of bias or are more interpretable.
    *   **Regular Model Retraining & Auditing:** Continuously monitor and retrain models with updated data and fairness checks.
    *   **Transparency:** Be transparent with users (where appropriate and understandable) about how AI makes decisions and the potential for bias.
    *   **Human Oversight:** Implement human oversight for critical or sensitive AI-driven decisions, especially those impacting user learning paths significantly.

This framework provides a foundation for building a secure, private, and ethically responsible learning environment within NeuroForge. It will be a living document, updated as the platform evolves and new regulations or best practices emerge.
