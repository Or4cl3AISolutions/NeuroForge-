## Data Management

*   **Knowledge Graph (Neo4j):**
    *   **Role:** Serves as the central repository for the semantic network of learning content. It maps `Concepts`, `Skills`, `ContentModules`, `LearningObjectives`, `Assessments`, and other educational entities, along with their complex interrelationships (e.g., `PREREQUISITE_OF`, `TEACHES_CONCEPT`, `DEVELOPS_SKILL`).
    *   **Enables:** Advanced content discovery, understanding of prerequisite chains, generation of personalized learning paths, and providing context to the AI Mentor.
    *   **Reference:** For the detailed schema, see [NeuroForge Neo4j Data Model](./neuroforge_neo4j_datamodel.md).
*   **Cognitive Profiling Data:**
    *   **Collection:** The Cognitive Profiling Service ingests a wide array of user interaction data. This includes navigation patterns, time spent on content, assessment performance (scores, specific answers, attempts), AI Mentor queries, explicit user feedback, and learning path progression.
    *   **Usage:** This data is preprocessed and fed into PyTorch models to generate behavioral heatmaps (visualizing engagement, mastery, difficulty across concepts/skills) and predictive learning trajectories (forecasting future progress and optimal paths). These profiles are then used to personalize the learning experience across the platform.
    *   **Reference:** For details on data sources and processing, see [NeuroForge Cognitive Profiling Design](./neuroforge_cognitive_profiling_design.md).

## AI Components

*   **AI Mentor:**
    *   **Role:** Acts as a personalized learning assistant, offering Socratic dialogue, explaining complex concepts, answering user questions, and suggesting relevant learning resources.
    *   **LLM Integration:** Leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) with a strategy to evaluate both leading API-based models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) and open-source alternatives (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral Large).
    *   **Memory:** Employs a dual memory system:
        *   **Short-term:** A conversation buffer for immediate dialogue context.
        *   **Long-term:** A vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) storing embeddings of conversation summaries, key entities, user goals, and feedback for persistent, context-aware interactions.
    *   **Customization:** Supports customizable interaction styles, including persona (e.g., Socratic Questioner, Encouraging Coach), verbosity, language/tone, and proactivity, primarily managed via system prompts and user-selectable profiles.
    *   **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Queries the NeuroForge Knowledge Graph Service to fetch definitions, understand relationships between concepts/skills, and suggest relevant, curated content modules, grounding its responses in factual information.
    *   **Reference:** For the conceptual design, see [NeuroForge AI Mentor Scaffolding](./neuroforge_ai_mentor_scaffolding.md).
*   **Cognitive Profiling (PyTorch-driven):**
    *   **Behavioral Heatmapping:** PyTorch models (e.g., RNNs, FFNs, potentially GNNs) process user interaction data to generate scores for engagement, mastery, struggle, and interest related to specific concepts and skills. These are visualized as heatmaps.
    *   **Predictive Learning Trajectories:** Sequence models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers) analyze historical user data and current profiles to forecast path completion likelihood, skill mastery probability, optimal next content, and identify at-risk users, enabling proactive interventions and adaptive path adjustments.
    *   **Reference:** For details on models and data processing, see [NeuroForge Cognitive Profiling Design](./neuroforge_cognitive_profiling_design.md).

## Blockchain Credentialing Overview

*   **Approach:** NeuroForge issues verifiable micro-credentials and diplomas as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on a public blockchain, ensuring user ownership, security, and portability.
*   **Platform:** **Polygon (PoS)** is the recommended platform due to its scalability, low transaction costs, EVM compatibility (allowing Solidity smart contracts), and robust ecosystem.
*   **Standards:**
    *   **NFTs:** Primarily **ERC-721** for unique, individual credentials.
    *   **Metadata:** Rich credential information (name, description, skills certified, issue date, evidence URL, etc.) is stored in a JSON file on **IPFS**. The `tokenURI` in the NFT links to this IPFS metadata file. The metadata structure aligns with ERC-721 standards and is compatible with Open Badges principles.
    *   **Optional Integration:** W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) can be integrated to enhance interoperability, with the NFT acting as a public anchor to a more detailed VC.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **User Ownership:** Users have true control over their credentials in their own crypto wallets.
    *   **Global Verifiability:** Credentials can be verified by anyone, anywhere, by checking the blockchain record and IPFS metadata.
    *   **Enhanced Security & Immutability:** Blockchain ensures credentials cannot be illicitly altered or revoked (unless specific mechanisms are designed).
    *   **Portability & Interoperability:** Standardized tokens are easily shareable and can be recognized across different systems.
*   **Reference:** For a detailed conceptual design, see [NeuroForge Blockchain Credentialing Design](./neuroforge_blockchain_credentialing_design.md).

## Security and Privacy Highlights

*   **Commitment:** NeuroForge is dedicated to implementing robust security measures and upholding user privacy as core tenets of the platform.
*   **Key Security Measures:**
    *   **Data Encryption:** End-to-end encryption with TLS 1.2+ for data in transit. At-rest encryption (e.g., AES-256) for all databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, Vector DBs), object storage, and backups, managed via a Key Management Service (KMS).
    *   **Access Controls:** Strong authentication (OAuth 2.0, OIDC, MFA) and granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).
    *   **Network Security:** Services deployed in Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) with strict firewall rules, IDS/IPS, and DDoS mitigation.
    *   **Application Security:** Secure coding practices (OWASP Top 10), regular security audits, penetration testing, dependency scanning, input validation, WAF, and secure secrets management.
    *   **Incident Response:** A documented plan for identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents, including post-incident analysis.
*   **Compliance Considerations:**
    *   **GDPR:** Strategies include lawful basis for processing, data minimization, robust consent management, upholding data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability), DPIAs for high-risk processing, DPAs with sub-processors, and breach notification procedures.
    *   **FERPA:** If applicable through institutional partnerships, NeuroForge will protect student education records, manage consent for disclosure, facilitate access rights, and adhere to directory information policies.
    *   **On-Device Anonymized Processing:** Conceptual exploration for client-side processing to enhance privacy.
*   **Ethical AI & Bias Monitoring:**
    *   Proactive monitoring of AI components (AI Mentor, Cognitive Profiling) for data bias, algorithmic bias, and interaction bias.
    *   Strategies include data audits, fairness metrics, user feedback channels, A/B testing, explainability techniques (XAI), and human review panels.
    *   Mitigation approaches involve data pre-processing, bias-aware model training, and output adjustments.
*   **Reference:** For the comprehensive framework, see [NeuroForge Security and Privacy Framework](./neuroforge_security_privacy_framework.md).

## Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Summary

*   **Title:** NeuroForge AI-Powered Concept Explanation and Content Recommendation PoC.
*   **Goal:** To validate the fundamental interaction loop and technical feasibility of integrating a simplified User Interface, the AI Mentor Service (using an external LLM), and the Knowledge Graph Service (with a minimal, manually populated Neo4j dataset). The PoC aims to demonstrate AI-generated explanations for concepts (grounded by KG data) and relevant content module suggestions.
*   **Key Components in PoC:**
    *   **Simplified UI** (basic web page or CLI).
    *   **AI Mentor Service** (using LLM API, logic for KG interaction, prompt engineering).
    *   **Knowledge Graph Service** (Neo4j with 2-3 concepts and modules, simplified API endpoints).
    *   **Mocked Services:** User Service (hardcoded `userId`), Content Delivery Service (placeholder content), Cognitive Profiling Service (mocked interaction logging endpoint).
*   **Scenario Highlight:** A user asks "What is [Concept X]?" The AI Mentor fetches data for Concept X from the KG, uses this data to prompt an LLM for an explanation, displays the explanation, and then suggests related content modules (also from the KG) to the user.
*   **Success Criteria:** Successful concept explanation using KG data via LLM, relevant content suggestion from KG, demonstrable API calls between components, and identification of basic technical risks.
*   **Reference:** For full PoC details, see [NeuroForge PoC Definition](./neuroforge_poc_definition.md).
