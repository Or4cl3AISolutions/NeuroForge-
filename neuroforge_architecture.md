# NeuroForge: High-Level System Architecture

## 1. Overall Architecture

We propose a **microservices architecture** for NeuroForge.

**Justification:**

*   **Complexity:** NeuroForge comprises diverse and specialized functionalities (AI mentoring, cognitive profiling, content delivery, credentialing). Microservices allow for modular design, breaking down this complexity into manageable, independently deployable units.
*   **Scalability:** Different components will have varying scaling requirements. For instance, the AI Mentor might need to scale independently of the Credentialing service. Microservices enable targeted scaling, optimizing resource utilization.
*   **Maintainability & Development Velocity:** Independent teams can work on separate services, accelerating development cycles and simplifying maintenance. Services can be updated or replaced with minimal impact on the overall system.
*   **Technology Diversity:** This architecture allows for selecting the most appropriate technology stack for each service, which is vital for NeuroForge's integration of specialized technologies like PyTorch, Neo4j, and blockchain.
*   **Resilience:** The failure of one service is less likely to cause a complete system outage, enhancing overall application resilience.

While microservices introduce complexities (e.g., inter-service communication, distributed data management), the long-term benefits for a system of NeuroForge's scope and ambition outweigh these challenges.

**Major Services/Modules:**

1.  **User Interface (UI) Service:** Frontend application(s) for web and potentially mobile platforms.
2.  **API Gateway:** A unified entry point for all client requests, handling routing, authentication, rate limiting, and request/response transformations.
3.  **User Service:** Manages user authentication, authorization, profiles, and account-related settings.
4.  **Cognitive Profiling Service:** Responsible for behavioral heatmapping. It processes user interaction data using a PyTorch model and manages cognitive profiles.
5.  **AI Mentor Service:** Powers the AI-driven learning assistant. Integrates with a chosen Large Language Model (LLM), manages conversation history, and utilizes a vector database for long-term memory and personalization.
6.  **Knowledge Graph Service:** Manages and provides access to the structured educational content and its interrelationships stored in Neo4j.
7.  **Content Delivery Service:** Delivers learning modules and resources to users, potentially integrating with a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
8.  **Credentialing Service:** Manages the creation, issuance, and verification of blockchain-based credentials for completed courses or achieved competencies.
9.  **Learning Pathway Service:** Generates and manages personalized learning paths based on user goals, progress, and cognitive profiles.
10. **Analytics & Reporting Service:** Aggregates data from various services to provide insights for users, educators, and administrators, powering dashboards and reports.
11. **Notification Service:** Handles various forms of user notifications (e.g., email, in-app messages, push notifications).
12. **Asynchronous Task Processing Service:** Manages background tasks such as report generation, large data processing, or complex AI model updates.
